Sustainability and environmental stewardship are core to the culture of <b><i>COEUS</i></b>, and its intelligent technology solutions.</p>
            <p class="fs-16">Together with our partners, we have successfully integrated sustainable bio-pellet solutions that achieve water, food and energy security, while protecting the ecosystems where it is grown and deployed. Incorporating our bio-pellets for power generation reduces both particulate and greenhouse gas emissions, reducing 13,800 barrels of oil for each 8,300 MT of bio-pellets generating one MW of electricity. Bio-pellets, also offers regions of the world, that are not logistically suitable in producing bioenergy crops, a viable alternative solution to meet their energy needs.</p>

Pelletization allows for a large  distribution radius to service co-fired biomass customers, where it is not possible to achieve a scalable production level of biomass.  This will enable restrictive regions of the US and its territories to achieve energy security by displacing 13,800 barrels of oil/yr, for every MW of power that local may demand.</p>

Two facilities in particular are set to grow by 400% to 1M tons within two years. Another facility plans to increase its use of wood-based fuel, from around 250,000 tons a year in 2016, to 1.2 million tons within two years.  The region overall is projected to grow exponentially due to strict governmental regulations, limiting nuclear and coal power production from the Asian Pacific region.</p>
